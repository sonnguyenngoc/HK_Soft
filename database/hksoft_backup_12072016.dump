21	fbappopen.jpg.800x600_q96.png	Facebook speeds-up Android software with ReDex	<p>Whilst millions of people call on Facebook to fix the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/01/uninstalling-facebook-app-saves-up-to-20-of-android-battery-life">battery drain</a> their apps cause, the social networking giant can't be criticised for its obsession with efficiency. During its annual F8 developer conference, Facebook announced a tool called ReDex which can speed-up Android software with little extra work from the developer. </p>\r\n<p>ReDex is employed internally to place the accelerator down on its own Android software, which has sped-up how quick the Facebook app opens by 15 percent and enabled the app to be 25 percent more responsive on modern smartphones. When compared to devices from 2011, the Facebook app now opens 25 percent faster. </p>\r\n<p>Facebook's tool focuses on ensuring the Android bytecode – a layer of code between the software and the operating system – is optimised and running as fast as possible. In a <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1480969635539475/optimizing-android-bytecode-with-redex/">blog post</a>, Facebook explained why it chose to focus on the bytecode: "The advantage of doing our optimizations at the bytecode level (as opposed to, say, on the source code directly) is that it gives us the maximum ability to do global, interclass optimizations across the entire binary, rather than just doing local class-level optimizations." </p>\r\n<p>"We opted to perform the transform on dex bytecodes rather than Java bytecodes because certain transforms can only be done post-DXing.

22	html5_EvUak3h.jpg.800x600_q96.png	HTML5 is ready for primetime, says W3C	<p>Steve Jobs famously put his weight behind HTML5 as the successor to Flash, and declared war on the latter <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">saying</a> "we strongly believe that all standards pertaining to the web should be open" in regards to Adobe's proprietary standard. Although support for HTML5 is available in most web browsers and operating systems, the standard itself had been considered incomplete - until today.</p>\r\n<p>Now the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published a recommendation of HTML5 which means it is stable enough to represent a set of features which people will be able to rely on for years to come...</p>\r\n<p>"Today we think nothing of watching video and audio natively in the browser, and nothing of running a browser on a phone," said Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director. "We expect to be able to share photos, shop, read the news, and look up information anywhere, on any device. Though they remain invisible to most users, HTML5 and the Open Web Platform are driving these growing user expectations."</p>\r\n<p><q>The standard is platform-agnostic, and therefore promotes the values of an open internet.</q></p>\r\n<p>As Berners-Lee mentions, a big advantage of HTML5 is the lack of plugin requirement. Web-based audio and video can be interacted with without the install of extra software, and rich applications can be created with access to bitmap canvas and scalable vector graphics for rendering graphs, games, and other visual imagery on-the-fly.</p>\r\n<p>The standard is platform-agnostic, and therefore promotes the values of an open internet. It's unsurprising then that Gartner identified HTML5 as one of their top 10 mobile technologies and capabilities for 2015 and 2016, saying HTML5 "will be an essential technology for organizations delivering applications across multiple platforms."</p>\r\n<p>But the work isn't over, not by a long-shot. In a <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/10/application-foundations-for-the-open-web-platform/">blog post</a>, W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe states that "now that HTML5 is done, W3C should do more to strengthen the parts of the Open Web Platform that developers most urgently need for success."</p>\r\n<p>Jaffe enumerates that these "Application Foundations" must be strengthened:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> identity, crypto, multi-factor authentication, privacy protection</li>\r\n<li><strong>Core Web Design and Development:</strong> HTML next generation, style, layout, graphics, animations, typography</li>\r\n<li><strong>Device Interaction:</strong> access to hardware and sensors such as bluetooth, NFC, vibration, etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Application Lifecycle:</strong> background tasks to manage offline, push, geofencing, sync</li>\r\n<li><strong>Media and Real-Time Communications:</strong> WebRTC, streaming media</li>\r\n<li><strong>Performance and Tuning:</strong> profiling, enhancements such hints and pre-loading, responsive design</li>\r\n<li><strong>Usability and Accessibility:</strong> ensuring the Web is accessible to all and supports the world's languages</li>\r\n<li><strong>Services:</strong> social Web, payments, annotations, Web of data</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>HTML5 has reached a key milestone in its development, and has the recommendation of the W3C for its use. Whilst it still has some work to go, the "write once, deploy everywhere" promise of HTML5 is coming to fruition and that's something for everyone to be excited about.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2014/oct/29/html5-ready-primetime-says-w3c/" target="_blank">http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2014/oct/29/html5-ready-primetime-says-w3c/</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 07:17:05.019261	2016-06-21 07:17:47.313156	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N

13	ubuntu-logo14.png	Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus Makes Its Debut	<p><a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.canonical.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.canonical.com/'); return false;" target="_blank">Canonical</a><span> on Thursday launched Ubuntu 16.04, aka "Xenial Xerus," an upgrade that will be supported for the next five years.</span></p>\r\n<p>The latest version for all desktop, server and cloud editions will be available for download starting Thursday.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu 16.04 includes four major technology advancements geared toward multiplatform uses. Xenial Xerus is the sixth Long Term Support release for Ubuntu. It marks the first time the platform is supported on mainframes, making it one of the world's largest and most powerful Linux systems, the company said.</p>\r\n<p>The new features will provide faster and simpler software delivery and operations and will form the foundation of many builds based on Ubuntu for every sector of IT, Canonical CEO Jane Silber said during a conference call announcing the release.</p>\r\n<p>Canonical will begin to phase in a rolling package upgrading system during the current release cycle, she said.</p>\r\n<p>"Snap is a fully functional feature in this release," Silber noted. "It is easy to update -- expect updates through four-to-six week cycles. Snap on the desktop will get the same treatment as phone updates. We will start to see more over-the-air updates."</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Vital for Survival</h2>\r\n<p>The latest releases are vital to Canonical's continuing health and evolution, observed Charles King, principal analyst at <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.pund-it.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.pund-it.com/'); return false;">Pund-IT</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu has set its sights on becoming a go-to Linux vendor across data center and industrial IoT environments, he told LinuxInsider.</p>\r\n<p>"The company's solutions resonate with several key market trends," said King. "The arrival of Ubuntu 16.04 marks a critical step for Canonical in pursuing its widening ambitions.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Snappy Innovation</h2>\r\n<p>Snap is the major innovation in all Ubuntu desktop editions. It is a new packaging format that runs alongside .deb, the traditional packaging format for Debian-based Linux distributions. Snaps will be available through the same ecosystem as the .deb packages.</p>\r\n<p>The advantage of Snap is the ability to speed delivery of newer apps to desktop users, said Silber. Updates, along with dependencies, are handled in a transactional manner. Only the deltas are updated.</p>\r\n<p>That approach brings greater efficiency to the distribution process, she explained.</p>\r\n<p>"Snap provides greater security through isolation policies," Silber pointed out. "Snap originated from the development of the Ubuntu phone. This furthers Canonical's progress along the convergence path."</p>\r\n<p>A companion technology, dubbed "Snapcraft," is a new developer tool for easier packaging and development of Snap apps.</p>\r\n<p>Snap is a "great step forward in terms of both security and creating a unified platform across desktops, mobile, tablet and IOT," said Silber.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Better Cloud and Container Platform</h2>\r\n<p>Ubuntu 16.04 brings LXD, a pure-container hypervisor that delivers 14 times the density and much greater speed for Linux guest compared to established traditional virtualization. LXD is part of LXC 2.0, the latest release of the Linux Containers project, and the basis for almost all Platform as a Service infrastructures in production today, according to Canonical.</p>\r\n<p>Using LXD as a hypervisor offers significant benefits for companies doing time-sensitive work on cloud infrastructure. For example, it improves performance for telco network-function virtualization, real-time analytics of financial transactions, media transcoding, and streaming. It also provides improvements to the cost of infrastructure for organizations with large portfolios of idle guest workloads, Canonical noted.</p>\r\n<p>"Ubuntu today is the language of scaleout workload, regardless of where they sit," Anand Krishnan, EVP of Canonical's cloud division, said during the conference call. "About 75 percent of all the Linux on the public cloud is Ubuntu. That is also true when you move to on-premises scaleout."</p>\r\n<p>More than half of OpenStack deployments run on Ubuntu, and the vast majority of Docker does as well, he said.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Security and Timing</h2>\r\n<p>The security features in the new Snap application package are likely to interest many business customers hoping to better protect their data center environments, noted King.</p>\r\n<p>The LXD hypervisor should benefit from the growing demand for container-based virtualization in OpenStack environments, he added.</p>\r\n<p>"It's interesting to note how carefully Canonical is positioning LXD as complementary to Docker's popular approach to containers," King said. "The support for Ubuntu on IBM's z Systems mainframes could pay significant dividends for the company among enterprise customers, and its work with Microsoft and Nexenta should open some intriguing doors."</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu is the top OS used for cloud deployments, according to David Mytton, CEO of <a href="https://www.serverdensity.com/" target="_blank">Server Density</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The level of support around containers from the big cloud providers, and even from legacy vendors, shows containers are the future of application deployment, he said.</p>\r\n<p>"Therefore, having LXD as a core part of the next Ubuntu LTS release is very important for Ubuntu to maintain its lead," Mytton told LinuxInsider. "LXD introduces host-level security, so containers running LXD do get the security of a VM without needing the overhead of running a full OS."</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">More Features Added</h2>\r\n<p>Ubuntu 16.04 also includes support for ZFS-on-Linux, a combination volume manager and filesystem that enables efficient snapshots, copy-on-write cloning, continuous integrity checking against data corruption, automatic filesystem repair, and data compression.</p>\r\n<p>Another storage improvement in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is support for CephFS. This a distributed filesystem that provides an ideal platform for large-scale enterprise storage for cluster computing on open technology.</p>\r\n<p>The latest Ubuntu release is the only distribution "to be in step with Mitaka on the day it is released," said Canonical's Krishnan.</p>\r\n<p>The OpenStack community earlier this month released the latest version of Mitaka, a widely deployed open source software for building clouds.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS creates a common platform for cloud and container computing across an incredible range of devices, Canonical said, from embedded ARM devices like the RaspberryPi, to the standard 32-bit and 64-bit Intel/AMD servers, and up to the most powerful IBM z, LinuxONE and POWER8 systems.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/" target="_blank">http://www.technewsworld.com/</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 06:41:33.371644	2016-06-21 06:42:08.004943	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
16	xl-2016-software-development-1.jpg	Disrupting Software Development in an On-Demand World	<p class="story-body">The idea that software is eating the world has become a generally accepted dictum since Marc Andreessen penned his milestone <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460" target="_blank">op-ed piece</a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Everywhere you look, industries and institutions are being disrupted by the unprecedented power of software. Now, the world is demanding a new way to develop software to keep pace with the pace of disruption.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest poster child for the brave new world of software-driven business is General Electric. "If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company," the company's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djB6BmBda6Q" target="_blank">CEO infamously said</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the changing needs of its customers and to fend off growing competition, GE is shifting its operations rapidly to a software-defined business. It is even spending millions of dollars to <a href="http://adage.com/article/btob/ge-debuts-owen-ads-oscars/302844/" target="_blank">recruit</a> software developers to drive this transformation process.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Rise of the Citizen Developer</h2>\r\n<p>As the competition for skilled software developers escalates, the impact of the consumerization of IT trend also is being felt in the software realm with the advent of the citizen developer. Citizen developers would build at least 25 percent of new business applications by 2014,<a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1744514" target="_blank"></a><a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.gartner.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.gartner.com/'); return false;">Gartner</a> predicted back in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Giving end users more power to build their own apps has become an even greater imperative as the competitive environment intensifies in almost every industry and customer expectations rise in an on-demand world of Uber, AirBnB, Spotify and other software-driven disruptive businesses.</p>\r\n<p>Although Gartner hasn't updated its forecast, most industry observers would agree that the power of citizen developers is growing as the ability to build your own apps, or BYOA, becomes easier and essential for business success.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Democratization of Development</h2>\r\n<p>The rise of the citizen developer also is being driven by a growing intolerance with the application gaps that historically have existed in the commercial offerings of established independent software vendors. Corporate end users (and executives) are seeking to fill those voids with specialized applications that meet their particular needs and better support their business processes.</p>\r\n<p>By their very nature, these organic, citizen developer-generated applications are built to be vendor-independent. That also enables organizations to build open digital ecosystems that are less dependent on specific ISVs and safeguards them from vendor lock-in. It's a trend known as "the democratization of the software development process."</p>\r\n<p>Although a growing assortment of development platforms and tools are available to enable business end users to quickly create apps to fill voids in their software portfolios, an equal number of issues are arising from the current approach to BYOA.</p>\r\n<p>First, user-friendly application development tools and platforms are still more suited for people who are software savvy. The most obvious example is the infinite array of open source software objects and utilities available. They may be free, but you need to know where to find them and how to use them. A growing number of companies, like Red Hat and Acquia, are proving that this isn't easy, and they're profiting helping users learn how to do it right.</p>\r\n<p>Second, many of the business-oriented development platforms are vendor- or application-centric. The best example of that reality is Salesforce's Force.com Platform as a Service. While the platform has attracted many corporate developers, they've all chosen Force.com because they have made a commitment to Salesforce's cloud solutions.</p>\r\n<p>Third and most importantly, none of those end-user-oriented development platforms includes a management component that enables an administrator to monitor and control the development process to ensure it complies with corporate policies and industry regulations.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Agile Alternatives</h2>\r\n<p>Traditional development utilities, open source tools and vendor-centric platforms don't meet those needs. A more agile and scalable alternative is necessary to fill the void.</p>\r\n<p>As the world becomes more digital and organizations must respond more quickly, the appeal of a new generation of on-demand software development alternatives will escalate.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/83341.html" target="_blank">http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/83341.html</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 06:55:32.567222	2016-06-21 06:55:49.005679	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
14	xl-2016-internet-of-things-2.jpg	Codenvy, Samsung Team to Power IoT Development	<p><a href="https://codenvy.com/" target="_blank">Codenvy</a><span> on Wednesday announced the beta release of the Samsung ARTIK IDE powered by </span><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse Che</a><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p>The release of the professional toolset is part of Samsung's partnership with Codenvy to make it easier to build, deploy and manage applications for the Internet of Things, Codenvy said.</p>\r\n<p>The ARTIK IDE is the first open source cloud IDE platform dedicated to IoT application development. It is based on Eclipse Che, a community-driven open source cloud IDE, workspace server and plug-in platform.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466491721.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>\r\n<p>Eclipse Che has had 100,000 downloads. Codenvy contributed to its development, along with SAP, IBM, Microsoft, SmartBear, Red Hat and Samsung, Codenvy CEO Tyler Jewell said.</p>\r\n<p>Samsung's ARTIK is a proprietary hardware module. The software stack that runs on the module is open source.</p>\r\n<p>"This is a unifying movement and a simplifying movement. It is designed to take a professional IDE platform like Eclipse and make it suitable to the targeted development approach in IoT," Jewell told LinuxInsider.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Door-Opening Technology</h2>\r\n<p>Samsung announced the ARTIC platform last year. It is a development platform designed to help both makers and professionals build IoT systems.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466491739.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>\r\n<p>Samsung ARTIK opened its doors to the community built around Eclipse IDEs, bringing more users to its growing set of developer tools.</p>\r\n<p>The IDE and the support of Samsung and the Eclipse Foundation open a new world for developers to build products and services that make IoT's potential a reality, said Jewell.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">What It Is</h2>\r\n<p>The ARTIK hardware has a modular design and a small-form-factor chip with a complete Linux OS based on Fedora 23 as an out-of-the-box product. Samsung also offers an option to use its own Titan Linux alternative OS or <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.canonical.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.canonical.com/'); return false;">Canonical's</a>Snappy platform.</p>\r\n<p>Developers can build out the platform on the chip and then deploy it as part of the ARTIK cloud. Samsung plans to offer its IoT platform for a range of development scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>The ARTIK Eclipse Che release makes workspaces on demand. It can appear anywhere and run in the cloud without any buffer installation, said Jewell. It creates for IoT a Web-style development model for embedded devices.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">What It Does</h2>\r\n<p>Samsung ARTIK IDE powered by Eclipse Che's features provide device discovery and management. That provides a way to manage the entire application life cycle, from building to editing to debugging, while the application runs on the device.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466491758.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>\r\n<p>Eclipse Che provides developers with multiple programming languages. It has default support for a wide range of languages, including C#, C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. It also provides project structure for easily transitioning applications to production with version control and modules.</p>\r\n<p>ARTIK developers can tap into open source community and get additional support from Samsung, Codenvy and the Eclipse Che community for best practices, ideas and troubleshooting. The product provides portability. A no-installation browser IDE allows development from a desktop, in the cloud or embedded directly within the device.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Significant Step</h2>\r\n<p>Open source is becoming more prominent in all things IoT and the cloud.</p>\r\n<p>With conventional mobile markets -- including higher-margin luxury handsets -- showing signs of maturity or even stumbling, IoT represents substantial future growth, said Charles King, principal analyst at <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.pund-it.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.pund-it.com/'); return false;">Pund-IT</a>.</p>\r\n<p>"The association with and leverage of Eclipse Che could be particularly interesting given its association with enterprise-centric vendors. If Samsung's ARTIK IDE establishes significant traction, it should place the company on very good footing to take advantage of IoT market opportunities," he told LinuxInsider.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Embedded Growth</h2>\r\n<p>Embedded device development until now has been driven by a small and well-understood community, but the proliferation of IoT devices means the community needs new tools to connect all the dots, according to Jewell.</p>\r\n<p>"The purpose of this project with Samsung was to create an IDE that was familiar to professionals but could be approachable by Web developers. That means you just opened up your development ranks by 60 million more," he said.</p>\r\n<p>However, competing forces may cause some interference for the Eclipse Che release, Pund-IT's King warned.</p>\r\n<p>"Though Arduino and Raspberry Pi are being positioned for IoT solutions, I believe Samsung faces greater competition from Intel, with its <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.quark.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.quark.com'); return false;">Quark</a>processors, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon IoT solutions," he said.</p>\r\n<p>"Intel seems particularly well-positioned since IoT is as much a data center play as it is about endpoint. That makes Samsung's work with the Eclipse community critical to the company's success," King added.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Cost Factor</h2>\r\n<p>The price of an <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit" onclick="window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit'); return false;">SDK</a> developer's board runs in the range of US$50 to $100, Jewell said. The module itself is a tiny form factor less than an inch square. Then you would pay per unit for commercial production of that. Since the software is all open source, there are no fees for distributing it.</p>\r\n<p>It is "an example of developers standing up and saying this is the development platform of the future," said Jewell. "We are pretty excited about what that means for that side of the open source community."</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/83439.html" target="_blank">http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/83439.html</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 06:50:00.283397	2016-06-21 06:50:35.546323	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
15	xl-2016-mit-bug-finder-1.jpg	MIT Researchers Forge New Weapon for Code Warriors	<p class="story-body">T researchers have developed a fast, accurate system for identifying security flaws in Web apps written in Ruby on Rails, according to news reports published last week.</p>\r\n<p>In tests the researchers -- MIT Professor Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Berkeley -- performed on 50 popular RoR apps, they uncovered 23 previously undiscovered security flaws.</p>\r\n<p>What's more, the longest amount of time it took to analyze any one program was 64 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>"Even if you wrote a small program, it sits atop a vast edifice of libraries and plug-ins and frameworks," said Jackson, who with Near plans to present their findings at the International Conference on Software Engineering in May.</p>\r\n<p>"So when you look at something like a Web application written in language like Ruby on Rails, if you try to do a conventional static analysis, you typically find yourself mired in this huge bog. And this makes it really infeasible in practice," he continued.</p>\r\n<p>Static analysis is a method for analyzing a program's code for security flaws.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Distinctive Research</h2>\r\n<p>To avoid the bog, Near devised a way to turn RoR itself into a static analysis tool so that running a program through the framework's interpreter produced an easy-to-follow, formal, line-by-line description of how the program handles data.</p>\r\n<p>Those methods are incorporated in a debugger called Space, which will be described in the paper to be aired in May.</p>\r\n<p>With Space, a program's data access procedures can be evaluated based on the ways applications typically access data. If it appears as though a program is accessing data in an atypical way, then chances are it has a security flaw.</p>\r\n<p>Using static analysis on access control vulnerabilities makes the research distinctive, noted Tim Jarrett, director of enterprise security strategy at <a href="http://www.veracode.com/" target="_blank">Veracode</a>.</p>\r\n<p>"They've chosen to solve a class of security problems that most static analyzers don't try to solve," he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n<p>"Most organizations that have built static analysis tools that focus on security issues are worried about attacks that allow data to be stolen from a database or deface a running website," Jarrett noted.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">False Positives</h2>\r\n<p>Instead of focusing on attackers running their own code within an application, Jackson and Near have turned their attention on access control problems. They want to make sure a user is authorized to do something in an application before any code is executed.</p>\r\n<p>For example, an online forum may want a visitor to log in before contributing to any topic threads. If visitors can write to threads without logging in, that would be a flaw in the code that might be flagged by the researchers' methods.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers' debugger appears to be more accurate than the human eye in identifying programming security flaws, Jarrett noted.</p>\r\n<p>"They ran the debugger against some class assignments that were graded, and they found a bunch of things in those applications that were not marked by a human reviewer as being a problem," he said.</p>\r\n<p>What's not known about the debugger is how many false positives it identified. A false positive is code identified as buggy but that actually is fine.</p>\r\n<p>"That's a problem in the real world because if you report a lot of false positives, what will typically happen is the software developer who is receiving the report will look at it and say, 'This is garbage,' and not look at any of the findings," Jarrett said.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Ruby's Limitations</h2>\r\n<p>False positives are a general problem with static analysis of software, observed Slawek Ligier, vice president of engineering for security for <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/" target="_blank">Barracuda Networks</a>.</p>\r\n<p>"Any tool that results in too many false positives for developers will not be used or applied correctly because development teams will have to spend too much time sorting out false positives from true vulnerabilities," he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n<p>"If you have to spend too much time sorting out chaff from what you really need to find, you will run into time constraints, and you won't able to do a good job," Ligier added.</p>\r\n<p>While the MIT research shows promise, it has limitations, he said. "Because it's focused on Ruby on Rails and how Ruby on Rails functions with its libraries, that's definitely a big limitation."</p>\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails has gained some popularity among younger software organizations but hasn't been widely adopted, Jarrett added.</p>\r\n<p>Less than 5 percent of all applications are written in RoR, he estimated. By comparison, 45 percent of applications are written in Java.</p>\r\n<p>"This is not a method that's going to instantly make every application running on the Internet more secure -- just the ones written in Ruby, and that's a relatively small number," Jarrett said.</p>\r\n<p>"This could become interesting," he added, "if they could figure out a way to extend this technique beyond Ruby and make it work for applications in other languages."</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/83389.html" target="_blank">http://www.technewsworld.com/story/83389.html</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 06:54:02.882327	2016-06-21 06:54:19.756744	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
17	ubuntu_studio_brandmark_v3_by_shitsukesen.png	Ubuntu Studio Is a Treasure Trove for Creative Types	<p><a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Studio 15.10</a><span> is a one-stop Linux OS shop for most creative people. It bundles a nearly full range of multimedia content-creation applications for workflows involving audio, graphics, video, photography and publishing.</span></p>\r\n<p>The developers describe this distro as a multimedia content-creation hub for all five creative workflows. The last element -- publishing -- is the weakest link. The publishing category in terms of the traditional wordsmithing genre is missing.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, you could take the time and effort to track down various desktop publishing and authoring tools. You can install tools for book publishing from the repo using Software Center, but that isn't the approach the distro provides for the other content-creation categories.</p>\r\n<p>The publishing applications preinstalled amount to the <a class="story-keyword-offsite" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.libreoffice.org/'); return false;">LibreOffice</a> Writer module and Scribus Desktop Publisher. Calibre, a popular tool for working with e-books, is available as an outside download only, despite being hawked as part of the toolset.</p>\r\n<p>The lack of a bundled publishing category is a turn-off. A better solution would be having a bundled set of publishing tools available as an add-on from the main menu.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">What's Inside</h2>\r\n<p>That annoyance aside, Ubuntu Studio offers creative users a hefty collection of some of the best multimedia creation and editing software stockpiled in Linux Land.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu Studio is an official Ubuntu subproject. The latest version, released last month, is based on Ubuntu 15.10, aka Wily Werewolf. Its preinstalled software includes the most common free multimedia applications available and is configured for best performance for each of its targeted user specialties.</p>\r\n<p>This is a transitional release that will be supported for nine months. It has a lot of application updating in terms of the Debian framework.</p>\r\n<p>The most noticeable change is the main menu category list, which has been compacted from five categories to three: Audio Production, Graphic Design and Video Production. The menu still has many more categories, such as Internet, Accessories, Media Playback and Office, and a smattering of uncategorized software titles and system controls.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Sound's Better</h2>\r\n<p>The Audio Production category is packed with sound producing and editing applications. Playback apps include the typical audio tools available in many Linux distros and then some. Ubuntu Studio gives you much more than one choice for numerous tasks. The sound production tools are even more extensive.</p>\r\n<p>For example, you get several submenus with professional-quality tools for sound effects, Instruments, Midi Utilities, mixers and card controls. Then the main Audio menu provides Ardour 4, Audacity, Brasero, Hydrogen, Internet DJ Console and a whole lot more.</p>\r\n<p>The selection is extensive and combines tools for individual instrumentation as well as apps for multimedia file editing and media burning. The bundle includes some of the best sound apps in the Linux Marketplace.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, LMMS is a basic music production tool for nonpros. MuseScore lets you create, play and print sheet music. Petri-Foo is a sound sampler. Pure Data is a visual data flow programming multimedia platform.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Sight and Sound</h2>\r\n<p>The Video Production category has a bit less to offer, but it's still a worthy collection of applications that range from amateur through almost pro-class offerings.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Blender lets you work with 3-D modeling, animation, rendering and postproduction tools all in one place. The developers must think this application is a real winner since they include it in the Graphic Design menu. This is the case with the Ristretto Image Viewer as well.</p>\r\n<p>DVDStyler is a video DVD production studio. You can do nonlinear video editing with Kdenlive. You can create and edit your own movies with Pitivi or use OpenShot to create and edit videos.</p>\r\n<p>Xjadeo is a simple video editor that syncs audio from jack transport. RecordMyDesktop lets you do just that by making a video recording of everything you do on your desktop. This is a handy way to visually document a how-to topic.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Photo Finish Finesse</h2>\r\n<p>As good as the Audio Production tools are in this distro, the Graphic Design compilation is even more impressive. Ubuntu Studio has an awesome collection of photography and graphic production packages that put most other specialty distro menus to shame.</p>\r\n<p>For example, its photography submenu includes Darktable to organize and develop images from digital cameras. Entangle lets you work with camera control and image captures from a tethered devise. Phatch Image Inspector is a tool for looking at EXIF and IPTC metadata.</p>\r\n<p>Other titles make it fast and easy to download photos and videos from external storage devices and mobile memory cards. RawTherapee is an advanced photo development program.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu Studio includes a handful of editing tools in this category that would better fill the missing publishing component. For instance, two programs for editing and managing fonts -- FontForge and Font Manager -- are included, along with the page layout and publication app Scribus.</p>\r\n<p>Several applications for editing and creating vector images and digital painting images are mixed into the Graphic Design menu. These include Krita, Inkscape, MyPaint and GIMP image editor.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Topnotch Usability</h2>\r\n<p>The Ubuntu Studio community sidestepped the default Ubuntu Unity desktop environment in favor of the classic Xfce desktop. This choice makes Ubuntu Studio an inviting option for both seasoned creative pros and Linux newcomers.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466492396.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p>The Xfce desktop is fast and easy to use. Its reputation for lightweight hardware demands make it suitable for most computing situations.</p>\r\n<p>A fully functional panel straddles the top of the screen and holds the expected notification displays on the right side and the main menu button in the left corner. The virtual desktop switcher is preconfigured and is easily adjusted.</p>\r\n<p>A second panel is preconfigured to slide into access at the bottom of the screen. This is a standard second fully functional panel that is set up to resemble an application dock or favorites bar. It's easily reconfigurable to suit individual user preferences.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466492421.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p>Right-click anywhere on the desktop to open a menu to launch applications and access various system settings and desktop properties.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<p>Ubuntu Studio 15.10 is a solid gateway for artistic enthusiasts and professional users coming into the Linux world. It caters more to graphic and audio specialties, but authors and publication makers have a reliable Linux OS to add the needed tools to round out the creativity hub.</p>\r\n<p>Ubuntu Studio is a proven Linux distro that is closely aligned with one of the more successful Ubuntu spin-off releases. Even as a computing platform for noncreative users, Ubuntu Studio can be a good choice.</p>\r\n<h2 class="subhead">Want to Suggest a Review?</h2>\r\n<p>Is there a Linux software application or distro you'd like to suggest for review? Something you love or would like to get to know?</p>\r\n<p>Please <a href="mailto:jack.germain@newsroom.ectnews.com">email your ideas to me</a>, and I'll consider them for a future Linux Picks and Pans column.</p>\r\n<p>Use the Talkback feature below to add your comments!</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/82755.html" target="_blank">http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/82755.html</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 07:01:06.397261	2016-06-21 07:01:16.305016	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
18	6441607321_39cf0ae9bc_o.jpg.800x600_q96.png	Opinion: If Flash is dead, is HTML5 now ready for the big time?	<p><em>Picture credit: "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidchief/6441607321/">HTML5 Logo On Screen</a>", by "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidchief/">David Martyn Hunt</a>", used under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a> / Modified from original</em></p>\r\n<p>There was a 17 year gap between HTML5, which was finalised and published on October 28 2014, and its predecessor HTML4. In that time, the technology landscape changed in virtually every conceivable way. Google was founded a year after HTML4 was finalised. Mark Zuckerberg was 13 years old. Steve Jobs had only just returned to Apple. Heck, in the UK, it would be a year until it was possible to send an SMS to someone on a different mobile network.</p>\r\n<p>Even though HTML5 has been in development since 2004, it wasn’t until April 2010 when a famous open letter by Steve Jobs called ‘Thoughts on Flash’ pushed it into the public sphere. Over the intervening years, there has been a lot of talk amongst developers and the media about whether HTML5 could replace native apps.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 has gone from strength to strength, winning major support from YouTube, who announced that HTML5 is now the default for its videos; Facebook, who announced it was shifting from Flash to HTML5; Google, who stopped supporting Flash entirely in its Chrome browser earlier this year; Amazon, who recently banned Flash advertising content on its site; even Adobe, who changed the name of its Adobe Flash Professional CC, now called Adobe Animate, specifically targeted at HTML5 development.</p>\r\n<p>Flash, therefore, is all but dead. Yet is HTML5 ready to take its place?</p>\r\n<p>If we were to look at this as the question alone, then yes, every use for Flash is being replaced by HTML5. HTML5 is the future of the web and the language which anyone developing web portals or sites should be using. As a language used to create responsive websites, HTML5 is most certainly what developers should be using.</p>\r\n<p>So yes, HTML5 is ready for the big time, if we’re speaking about web development.</p>\r\n<p>If we’re talking about apps, where much of the focus has been, and whether HTML5 is going to overtake native development and be the main language people use for mobile engagement; the answer becomes more complicated.</p>\r\n<p>The things that we do with our smartphones and the number of devices we use has also changed rapidly. As apps have continued to gain popularity and capabilities, the role that native development plays has also increased.</p>\r\n<p>Now, HTML5 is trying to play catch up with the capabilities of native development. The likelihood is it never will, for one express reason best illustrated by Peter-Paul Koch of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/web_vs_native_l.html">Quirksmode</a>. “Technically, it’s simple,” he writes. “The web cannot emulate native perfectly, and it never will. Native apps talk directly to the operating system, while web apps talk to the browser, which talks to the OS. Thus there’s an extra layer web apps have to pass, and that makes them slightly slower and coarser than native apps. This problem is unsolvable.”</p>\r\n<p>While the web may not be able to emulate native, according to the Vision Mobile State of the Developer Nation Q3 2014 HTML5 is the most used language by developers at 42%. HTML5 is commonly used in the development of hybrid apps, using tools such as Cordova. </p>\r\n<p>As much as web technologies are progressing, so too are the features and experiences that can be obtained through native development. As the number of devices that we use increases, there has become an increasing expectation that the experience will be tailored to each device type. Today, many apps that get built are hybrid in one way or another, with developers choosing where to use native functionality and where to use web technologies.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 is the future of websites, as it is the language that is best suited for the changing landscape, to support smartphones, tablets and desktops. It is also the language that is the best base for creating web-apps that can run on desktop or mobile devices. This suits apps that are lighter, in terms of functionality, or require less access to hardware or OS level services, than apps that work best natively.</p>\r\n<p>In comparison to a few years ago, there are now more tools and frameworks to support HTML5 development. The ecosystem around it has started to mature. Compared with HTML4, at the same point in its release, there is already vastly more support for HTML5. This has everything to do with the role that the Internet plays in the world today, compared to 1998, when it was just getting started with revolutionising everything. </p>\r\n<p>Now, mobile and other connected devices are continuing that revolution. For the web though, HTML5 isn’t just ready for the big time. It is the big time.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2016/jan/26/if-flash-dead-html5-now-ready-big-time/" target="_blank">http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2016/jan/26/if-flash-dead-html5-now-ready-big-time/</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 07:05:56.221497	2016-06-21 07:08:08.518933	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
19	Responsive-Example.png	Responsive Web & Mobile Apps: How to approach your digital roadmap	<p>The details of a company's digital roadmap can seem daunting; what to do, and when to do it can seem like a never ending list of possibilities, but really all it comes down to is what do the customers need and what does the business need?</p>\r\n<p>Answering these questions within the context of "now, next and later" helps to demystify the roadmap no matter how large the organisation or ambitious the startup.</p>\r\n<p>If you’re faced with a varied set of user-journeys and wide range of functionality or tasks, producing a responsive website built on one code base that works on multiple devices will most-likely offer the best solution. Responsive sites play an important part at the initial acquisition stage too, when a user might explore and interact with a brand or service over multiple devices whilst making that choice.</p>\r\n<p><q>Any digital deployment should be to improve the customer interaction</q></p>\r\n<p>Once onboard, they might then have a wide range of tasks to complete and often the more complex tasks that might begin on mobile will need to finish on a desktop. A single responsive website can tick all of these boxes and provide a fantastic foundation for any company’s digital offering.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a focused set of user journeys, tasks, and subsequent functionality - then you should consider looking at a native application. If you look at the most successful applications they have a specific purpose, which is what makes them worthy of a download and regular interaction. Where you identify the functionality that drives regular interaction, you’re changing the way that user behaves and brings the service closer to them. It’s that regular interaction, access to offline content and deep-linking between other apps and hardware that builds the user (and business) case for a native application.</p>\r\n<p>Integration to internal back end systems, web services and third party APIs are of course core things to consider. You can have all the bells and whistles you want on a website or app, but if the right data isn’t moving towards the user and the business – you’ll be wasting budget.</p>\r\n<p><q><span>All users have experiences where digital makes their day easier through responsive websites and native applications</span></q></p>\r\n<p>For start-ups, it tends to be easier. They’re more often than not starting with a blank sheet. For big enterprise companies, who’ve grown both organically and through acquisition on a global scale, you’ll often have a bigger challenge to unravel. The most important things to consider are future-proofing and trying to keep the user-layer ‘light’ so that the end experience is as fluid as possible for all users, and plugging in any future developments to your data (e.g. <a href="http://www.iottechexpo.com/europe/track/wearables/">wearables</a>) should be an easy task.</p>\r\n<p>The point of any digital deployment should be to improve the customer interaction with the business and its products or services. But it’s crucial to not limit those improvements to just your customers. Don’t forget about your internal users. The smartest balance to any digital roadmap will take into consideration true end-to-end integration not just through data systems, but through the business processes themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Managing internal workflows and reporting should be fully-integrated with external facing websites and apps, empowering your staff in the same way as your customers.</p>\r\n<p>To visualise this, let’s apply it to a real-life scenario:</p>\r\n<p>New Customer using a Responsive Website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>They want help with financial planning, so they search for financial consultants over the course of a few days in different scenarios using their phone, tablet and laptop</li>\r\n<li>Once they’ve chosen a consultancy, they use that provider’s website to login and plan their finances across everything from short to long-term goals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Long Term Customer using a Native Application:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>As a long term customer, a native application could add value with push notifications and immediate updates or alerts surrounding changes to their financial situation</li>\r\n<li>Quick ‘one tap’ appointment setting and integration to calendar apps could also play a part here</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Financial Consultant using a Native Application:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Using a sales-focused app, the consultant here can have relevant information about each customer and market data at their fingertips ahead of and during client meetings</li>\r\n<li>This app could download and store the information so that connectivity during meetings isn’t mission critical</li>\r\n<li>Live modelling with customer data will allow for decisions to be captured through the app and sent back to the office for processing as and when connectivity is available</li>\r\n<li>Appointment setting could also be handled with seamless calendar app integration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Internal-facing team using a Responsive Website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Information comes into this secure web portal from the consultant’s native app and customer-facing website</li>\r\n<li>Tasks are monitored and assigned</li>\r\n<li>As tasks are completed, the relevant outputs are sent out to both customer and consultant</li>\r\n<li>Team leaders and higher management can carry out reports on the website based on internal workflows and customer behaviour - thus driving further digital and commercial strategy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Throughout this entire scenario, all users have experiences where digital makes their day easier through responsive websites and native applications adding value where they’re needed. Initial exploration and bigger and broader tasks are suited to the responsive website solution – with focused activity being taken care of within native applications.</p>\r\n<p>The most important things when considering deploying a website or app are the user and business cases, what will make the customer’s day better and what will help the business run more efficiently? With those focused goals at the heart of a roadmap, a solid IT architecture, and effective operational processes – you will be well aligned to exceed your customers’ expectations now and in the future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are your main considerations when deploying a responsive website or native app?

23	html5.jpg.800x600_q96.png	Why native app performance still beats HTML5?	<p>According to Forrester research, native mobile apps outperform their HTML5 counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 apps are a one size fits all approach where just one set of code is created for every platform. Native apps are designed specifically for a certain operating system. One of the major points of differentiation in the performance of each type of app is load speeds. Serdar Yegulalp of<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-development/forrester-html5-apps-still-not-good-native-apps-235189" target="_blank">InfoWorld</a> writes:</p>\r\n<p>Mobile HTML5 apps are known to be slower than native mobile apps. Some of this is due to delayed updates or bugs in stock browsers on mobile platforms.</p>\r\n<p>Also, Forrester found that 59% of time, HTML5 apps took longer than planned to complete with a lot of time lost fixing issues and retesting. Despite this, Forrester’s survey in October 2013 showed that 43% of IT managers were using HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>But don’t completely discount the usefulness of HTML5 apps. Forrester notes that they still have their place like for apps that put content over interaction. Also, it is possible to use a hybrid approach of both native and HTML5. Serdar Yegulalp sums up the Forrester report quite well:</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 is useful as one weapon in the mobile arsenal, but is still no silver bullet.</p>\r\n<p>When creating a mobile app, there are a variety of factors, like cost and time, to weigh when deciding between a native or HTML5 approach. One major part of the equation should be the effect this choice will have on your user’s sentiment. For example, if your app is taking too long to <a href="http://www.utest.com/load-testing" target="_blank">load</a>, it may instill negative feelings.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you choose HTML5 or native apps, pay special attention to load time.

Since then, many Android developers have adopted some form of the language (whether a complete makeover or just borrowing some elements to fit-in with the rest of the OS.)</p>\r\n<p>Google announced MDL (Material Design Lite) earlier this week to help web developers bring the design to their websites using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. MDL is also framework-agnostic, which means it can be used with any front-end solution a developer or designer wishes to use. </p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466493715.jpeg" /></p>\r\n<p>For an idea of how "lite" the new MDL tools are, the Gzipped code is under 27kb. If a developer feels a complete Material Design isn't appropriate to their needs, they can take just pieces of the 'Paper' elements to use (such as a graph.)</p>\r\n<p><q>MDL is also framework-agnostic, which means it can be used with any front-end solution</q></p>\r\n<p>The tools are responsive and will function on any modern browser such Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera. If you haven't gathered yet, it's clear Google wants to make it as simple as possible to push its vision for the future of design wherever there is technology for it to grace. </p>\r\n<p>Material Design is the brainchild of respected ex-WebOS designer, Matias Duarte. It is based on the simple principles of paper but modernised for the digital world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%ADas_Duarte">Duarte</a> explained that "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." </p>\r\n<p><img src="/uploads/editor/1466493720.jpeg" /></p>\r\n<p>Over the past year Google has updated most of their own apps on Android, iOS, and the Web to fit with the Material Design principles and show its benefits. On Android, Material Design can be used in Android version 2.1 and up via the v7 appcompat library (which is used on virtually all Android devices that were made after 2009.) </p>\r\n<p>You can grab MDL via Google's <a href="http://www.getmdl.io/started/index.html">content delivery network</a>, but the code is also up on <a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-lite">GitHub</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2015/jul/08/google-advances-its-material-design-takeover/" target="_blank">http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2015/jul/08/google-advances-its-material-design-takeover/</a></p>		\N	2016-06-21 07:22:18.400053	2016-06-21 07:22:30.987332	9			t	normal	1	t	\N	\N	\N
20	bloudsaaofapps.jpg.800x600_q96.png	HyperDev – the 'fastest' way to develop web apps	<p>The founders of Stack Overflow and Trello, Fog Creek, have announced the open beta of HyperDev which is pitched as being the 'fastest' way to develop web applications. </p>\r\n<p>Due to launch in open beta on May 31st, HyperDev is a collaborative tool which enables developers to focus on writing code for building full-stack web apps while the platform handles automated deployment and instant hosting. As the app is being coded, it can be deployed live to servers. </p>\r\n<p>“By making web development faster, easier and more accessible, developers can now create apps faster and try out more ideas,” said Joel Spolsky, a founder of Fog Creek. “Now, developers can finally get to working on all the projects they’ve been meaning to get around to.” </p>\r\n<p>A key aim of the platform is to ensure developers' creativity is able to flourish, unshackled from the added complexity of configuring servers, running commands, compiling files, setting up build pipelines, and mastering version control systems. </p>\r\n<p>“Sometimes you just need to get something up and running,” Spolsky adds. “HyperDev is a scratch pad for your code. Development is quick and users have their own permanent space on the web where their apps are already live and accessible via a URL. It’s like getting your own server and editing live, so you can find out straight away whether your thing works, or whether people will use it.” </p>\r\n<p>Enabling simple collaboration with others in a 'Google Docs-style' environment helps to speed-up the web app development process further. Projects can be shared by exchanging code via URL and shared projects can also be ‘remixed’ so that developers can work from a copy of existing code and implement changes. </p>\r\n<p><em>The open beta of HyperDev is due to go live on May 31st. You can find out more information about the platform and register your interest <a href="https://hyperdev.com/about/">here</a>. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you plan on trying HyperDev when it launches?
